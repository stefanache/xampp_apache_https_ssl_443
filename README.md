In the past I seen 2 very interesting links:
            https://shellcreeper.com/how-to-create-valid-ssl-in-localhost-for-xampp/
            https://florianbrinkmann.com/en/4215/https-virtual-hosts-xampp/
and I want to reduce the work to create the url like https://site.test  if have xampp already installed on windows 10.
